- Their are 2 different ways of writting Javascript in HTML
1. The first way is writting JavaScript in the head tag section of the HTML file. In this method JavaScript is written in between the open script tag and the closing script tag.
2. The second method is by linking JavaScript file to the HTML file using the script tag. The src(source) attribute of the script tag is used to link the JavaScript file.
